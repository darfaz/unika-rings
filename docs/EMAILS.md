### Email 2: Founder Story (Day 2)
**Subject:** Why I'm building this (a quick story)
**Preview:** It started with a compliment I couldn't accept...

---

Hey,

Quick story about why Unika Rings exists.

I love my Oura Ring. It tracks my sleep, my recovery, my heart rate — it's genuinely changed how I think about my health.

But every time someone noticed it and asked "what's that?" — I found myself *apologizing* for how it looked. "It's a health tracker, I know it doesn't really match my outfit..."

That bugged me. Why should the best health wearable on the market look like... a plain metal band?

So I started designing snap-on covers. Something that would transform the Oura Ring from "tech gadget I tolerate" to "jewelry I'm proud to wear."

That's Unika — the idea that your health tracker should match your style, not fight it.

More design sneak peeks coming this week 👀

### Email 3: Product Deep-Dive (Day 5)
**Subject:** The engineering behind the "snap" 🔬
**Preview:** How we built a cover that doesn't mess with your sensors...

---

Hey,

One question I get a lot: "Won't a cover mess up my Oura's sensors?"

Short answer: No.

Here's why:

**Open-bottom design** — The bottom of your Oura Ring is where all the magic happens (LEDs, temperature sensor, accelerometer). Our covers leave that entire area completely exposed. Zero interference.

**Snap-fit engineering** — No adhesives, no glue, no tape. The cover snaps onto the outer surface of your ring using a precision friction fit. Slides on in 2 seconds, comes off just as easily.

**Premium materials** — Not cheap silicone that yellows in a week. We use [material details] that looks and feels like jewelry.

The result: your Oura Ring works exactly the same. You just look better wearing it.

Hey,

Real talk: we're capping VIP reservations at [X] spots.

Why? Because our first production run has a limited number of units, and VIP backers get priority. Once we hit the cap, the 40% discount goes away.

We're at [Y]% capacity right now.

If you've been thinking about it, now's the time.
