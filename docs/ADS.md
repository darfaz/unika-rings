- Kill any ad set with CPL > $5 after 3 days

### Phase 2: Scaling ($30-50/day, 4 weeks)
- Scale winning audiences (increase budget 20% every 3 days)
- Test new creatives on winning audiences
- Switch optimization to "Conversions" (email signup or purchase)
- Introduce retargeting campaign for website visitors

### Phase 3: Launch Boost ($50-100/day, launch week)
- All budget on conversion-optimized campaigns
- Heavy retargeting of email list + website visitors
- Lookalike audiences of $1 reservation payers
- Daily creative refresh to avoid ad fatigue
